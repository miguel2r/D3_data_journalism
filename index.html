        <h2>Current trends shaping people's lives.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The following graphs are showing some insights about the relationships of some of the most important factors that 
          some demographics area in US are currently facing. The data is in percentages and by state. The data set included here 
          is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates and was taken from https://factfinder.census.gov. The following variables were
          taken in account for this Data Analysis: Poverty, Age, Income, Healthcare, Obesity & Smokes.

          <h2>Poverty vs Healthcare</h2>
          <p>Poverty  has a lot of consequenses in a human life, and  Healthcare is not the exemption. As individuals it is dificult to get a good
            Health condition if we can not pay for it. Goverments are trying to take care of this but now days the Healthcare System
            requires the contribution of the goverment and also of us as individuals to support the Healthcare System.
          </p>
          <p>The  graph above is showing a positive relationship between Heathcare and Poverty in percentage terms. We can observe some US states
            where the percentage of poverty is less that  12 % and the lack of Healthcare is around 4 %, this is the example of MA, were
            based on the graph the people that is  living there got a good economy and because of it ,they might have good healthcare system as this data
            is reflecting.
          </p>
          <p>On the other hand we can observe that if the poverty rate gets incresed, then the lack of Heathcare increase too.Therefore we can confirm
            that a bad economic situation lead into to a lack of Healthcare opportunities, as we observe in this graph the MS Mississippi State case.

          <h2>More relationships to explore, so you can find your own insights.</h2>
          <p>We want to allow you to explore by yourslef this graph and  find out, how some of the variables behave between each other. The idea is to stablish
            some of the relationships you might be interrested in, and get your own conclusions. As you will see 
            some of these variables are very interresting to explore and it might lead you to have an overview  on
            social factors that are currently affecting to this demographics population.    
          </p>
